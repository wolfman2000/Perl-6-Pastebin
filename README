This Catalyst app is meant to host Perl 6 programs
and give them syntax highlighting if it works.

Present Bugs:

    1) Testing the DB portions requirs SQLite right now.
    2) PerlCritic and PerlTidy are evil, yet occasionally necessary.
    3) Syntax::Highlight::Perl6 doesn't always works as it should.

Run script/p6paste_server.pl to test the application.
